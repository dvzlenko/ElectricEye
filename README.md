# ElectricEye

This repo contains a set of utilitues aimed to process the raw data on the electric activity of fishes, obtained in A.N.Severtsov Institute of Ecology and Evolution. The utilitues were developed in the frame of the resctrictions of the data type and format, so they are not universal and can be used only with the certain data files.

The raw electric data collected using two 32-channel ADCs, so we do have two raw files per each experimental session.
